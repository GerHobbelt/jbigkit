Ideas which I may implement in one of the next releases:

  - routine which prepares incompletely decoded images for Xlib

  - call-back function for progress meter

  - use more efficient resolution reduction code suggested by
    Dr. Klaus Bartz <bartzkau@kou3.ina.de>

  - investigate whether there is a standard way of embedding JBIG
    into TIFF and implement it (see also RFC 2301)

  - eliminate warning messages from compilers other than GCC

  - multichannel (e.g., RGB) support, PPM support

  - compile-time option to remove progressive encoding and
    resolution-reduction support (in the interest of reducing code
    size and attack surface for software patent lawyers)

  - investigate how to best deal with broken BIEs that contain
    multiple NEWLEN marker segments, which are not permitted by ITU-T
    T.85, but which have been observed coming from some fax machines;
    possible options for jbg_newlen(): use first, last, or minimum
    value

  - version of jbg_newlen() for dealing with BIEs that are split
    into several blocks
