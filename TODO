Features that may appear in some future release regarding jbig.c:

  - function to prepare incompletely decoded images for display by Xlib

  - use a more efficient resolution-reduction method suggested by
    Dr. Klaus Bartz <bartzkau@kou3.ina.de>

  - investigate whether there is a standard way of embedding JBIG
    into TIFF and implement it (see also RFC 2301)

  - test for and eliminate warning messages from compilers
    other than GCC

  - multichannel (e.g., RGB) support, PPM support

  - JBG_VERSION should have been numeric, for easier comparison in
    #ifdefs. (suggested by David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org>)

  - add dynamic library target to Makefile (patch by David Woodhouse),
    for the benefit of Linux packagers

  - perhaps back-port new NEWLEN look-ahead from jbig85.c to jbig.c

The following past feature requests for jbig.c probably have become
less important since the release of jbig85.c:

  - compile-time option to remove progressive encoding and
    resolution-reduction support (in the interest of reducing code
    size and attack surface for software patent lawyers)

  - investigate how to best deal with broken BIEs that contain
    multiple NEWLEN marker segments, which are not permitted by ITU-T
    T.85, but which have been observed coming from some fax machines;
    possible options for jbg_newlen(): use first, last, or minimum
    value

  - version of jbg_newlen() for dealing with BIEs that are split
    into several blocks

  - call-back function for progress meter

Features that may appear in some future release regarding jbig85.c:

  - man pages for pbmtojbg85 and jbgtopbm85
